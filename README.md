# poc-automation-github-actions

A Repository that contains all of our GitHub Actions.

Each individual actions should contain a Dockerfile, an entrypoint (could be a `bash` script, or whatever you want), and a `README.md` which describes what the action does and how it should be used from a `.workflow` file.
